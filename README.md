# Work-Day-Calender

## Description 
I created the workday planner application in order to help employees and workers effectively view and manage the hours they work during a typical day. This application is designed to layout the standard working hours in hourly blocks with dynamic highlighting (grey to show you past hours in the workday, red to show you the current hour, and green to show you future hours). The user can type their to-dos or activities taking place in the relevant hour block to be save in local storage, so the user is free to refresh the page without losing what they have typed into the input boxes. I created this application utilizing the starter HTML and CSS code then adding functionality using javascript in VS code then publishing on Github. 

The deployed application can be found here >> https://carolineablynch.github.io/Work-Day-Calender/ and my Github repository can be found here >> https://github.com/carolineablynch/Work-Day-Calender.git

## Installation 
You can download my code from the github repository listed above into VS code for further analysis/development or you can access the deployed site using the link above in a web browser. 

## Usage 

You will see screenshots below from the deployed application where you can see the time blocks and where the user is able to enter their activies/to-dos for each hour in the "enter your tasks here" input box. This application is designed to layout the standard working hours in hourly blocks with dynamic highlighting (grey to show you past hours in the workday, red to show you the current hour, and green to show you future hours).

I utilized my TA Andrew Bautista and my tutor Juan Delgado when I ran into some problems to bouce some ideas off of.
